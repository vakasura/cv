          I&apos;ve worked at some of Canada&apos;s most innovative tech companies and
          most recently at <b>Martian (CB Insights Top 100 AI Companies)</b>,

          In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects, reading and writing
          about philosophy, and <b>trying my best to pop off on X</b>. I believe in
          continuous learning and strive to improve my skills every day.
